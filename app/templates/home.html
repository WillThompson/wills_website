		<h1>Who am I?</h1>
		My name is Will. I am a Mathematician living in Vancouver, BC.<br><br>

		I obtained my Ph.D. at UBC in Applied Mathematics where I studied the effects of random noise on nonlinear dynamical systems. I have a real job now, but remain curious about various topics in math, statistics, and physics.<br><br>

		To balance out my academic credentials I have started taking an interest in coding and creating web-based tools. I am also fascinated with machine learning and data analysis, so I have begun to look deeper into this for personal and professional interest.

		<h1>What is this?</h1>
		To learn how to make some simple web applications, I had converted an old laptop into a little server. I had fun learning about how to setup websites and such, so I decided to get a more reliable computer so that I could explore this more fully. <br><br>

		I am a fan of python for its high ease-of-use to power ratio. Hence, I am using <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">flask</a> to code this little website. It is my intention that the things I write here can be of use for fun but maybe for something useful at some point.<br><br>

		For when I want to talk about math-related things, I will also publish some stuff here. Here is a beautiful equation: $$ e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$$
