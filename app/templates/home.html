		<h1>Who am I?</h1>
		Thanks for taking the time to visit! My name is Will. I am a data scientist and applied mathematician living in Vancouver, BC.<br><br>

		I obtained my Ph.D. at UBC where I studied the effects of random noise on nonlinear dynamical systems. The focus of my thesis was systematic dimensionality reduction methods for dynamical systems with multiple time scales and heavy-tailed stochastic driving. Here is a beautiful equation: 

		$$ e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0.$$

		I am a fellow at <a href="https://www.insightdatascience.com/">Insight Data Science</a> where I worked on <i>Patreon Pro</i>, which offers recommendations for users for how to improve their Patreon campaign pages. I learned about natural language processing methods and setting up apps on Amazon Web Services over the course of this project. <br><br>

		I am a former compliance mathematician/statistician for an online gaming test laboratory, where I was responsible for analysing the mathematical and statistical character of games as well as the random number generators that serviced them. <br><br>

		For coding, I am a fan of python for its ease-of-use and its efficacy for data analysis and enjoy using <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">flask</a>, a python library for web development. In fact, it is running this little website on AWS. I am also experienced in R and, to a lesser extent, Java.<br><br>
