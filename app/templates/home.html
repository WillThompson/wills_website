		<h1>Who am I?</h1>
		My name is Will. I am a Data Scientist and Applied mathematician living in Vancouver, BC.<br><br>

		I obtained my Ph.D. at UBC where I studied the effects of random noise on nonlinear dynamical systems. The focus of my thesis was systematic dimensionality reduction methods for dynamical systems with multiple time scales and heavy-tailed stochastic driving.<br><br>

		I am a Fellow at <a href="https://www.insightdatascience.com/">Insight Data Science</a> where I worked on <i>Patreon Pro</i>, which offers recommendations for users for how to improve their Patreon campaign pages. I learned about Natural Language Processing and setting up apps on AWS over the course of this project.

		<h1>What is this?</h1>
		Before learning about the wonders of AWS, I converted an old laptop into a little server. I had fun learning about how to setup websites and little web appliets, so I decided to get a more reliable computer so that I could explore this more fully. <br><br>

		I am a fan of python for its ease-of-use and its efficacy. Hence, I am using <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">flask</a> to code this little website. It is my intention that the things I write here can be of use for fun but maybe for something useful at some point.<br><br>

		For when I want to talk about math-related things, I will also publish some stuff here. Here is a beautiful equation: $$ e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$$
