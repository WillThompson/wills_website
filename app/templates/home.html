<h1>Who am I?</h1>
My name is Will. I am a mathematician interested in learning how to make some simple web applications. I am a fan of python for its high ease-of-use to power ratio. Hence, I am using flask to code this little website.

It is my intention that the things I write here can be of use for fun but maybe for something useful at some point.

<h1>What is this?</h1>
This is my attempt to learn how to code a few things in flask. This is meant to serve as a springboard from which I can learn some additional coding. Ideally, it would also be possible to write some maths here as well.

<form class="form" method="post" action="">
<div class="form-group">
    <label for="first">First word</label>
    <input type="text" class="form-control" id="first" name="test1">
</div>
<div class="form-group">
    <label for="second">Second Word</label>
    <input type="text" class="form-control" id="second" name="test2" >
</div>
<button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Submit</button>
</form>
