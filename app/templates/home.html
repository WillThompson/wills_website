<h1>What is this?</h1>
This is my attempt to learn how to code a few things in flask. This is meant to serve as a springboard from which I can learn some additional coding. Ideally, it would also be possible to write some maths here as well.

This is the most beautiful equation:
$$ \exp(i\pi) + 1 = 0.$$
